CakePHP Social Harvester

A project built on CakePHP (http://cakephp.org/) to help gather social media data for processing.

It aims to make data available from Facebook and Twitter, but more APIs and social media networks can be added via CakePHP's Datasource feature: http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/models/datasources.html

Some of the technologies also involved:
- Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
- HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- D3.js (http://mbostock.github.com/d3/)

This app is far from finished! Feel free to message (via GitHub) the original author, Ariel Kirkwood (@neonelectro) if you're interested in helping out.
